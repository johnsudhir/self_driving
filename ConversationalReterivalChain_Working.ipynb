But under the \\nfrequency of more extreme weather, growing demand, and \\nunderinvestment in transmission infrastructure, the grid is showing signs \\nof weakness.  \\nThere are two co ncepts that are interrelated – reliability and resiliency. To \\nmeet the end goal of “keeping the lights on”, the electric grid must be \\nresilient enough to bounce back from disruptive events quickly.  \\nGrid reliability is the ability of the power system to del iver electricity in \\nthe quantity and with the quality demanded by users. The nation’s largest \\ngrid operator, PJM Interconnection, defines reliability as “designing, \\nrunning, and maintaining electricity supply to provide an adequate, safe, \\nand stable flow o f electricity.” This is accomplished by having enough \\ngeneration resources to meet all power demands and having enough \\nbuilt -in redundancy to minimize the effects of single point failures. \\nReliability is the supreme measurement of grid performance. Even wi th \\nsuccessful investments in grid modernization, utilities still measure their \\ncustomer and regulatory performance on their ability to reliably deliver \\nelectricity.  \\nOn the other hand, resiliency has become a hot topic over the past few \\nyears due to more fr equent extreme weather events and increased grid \\nsabotage. In fact, attacks against the electrical grid nationwide are at an \\nall-time high. According to Department of Energy statistics, human \\nattacks were responsible for 171 “electric disturbance incidents ” around \\nthe country in 2022, compared with 99 in 2021. (Department of Energy \\nlabeled this as the result of vandalism, sabotage, actual physical attack, \\ncyber event, and suspicious activity.) The grid’s ability to recover from \\nadversity is at the root of r esiliency. Disruptive events can and do occur \\nand the grid should be designed to bounce back quicker.  \\n  \\nOur reality – the current state  \\nOur electric infrastructure is aging, and it is being pushed to do more than \\nit was originally designed to do. To date, power transmission', metadata={'source': './CgBotTesting.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='infrastructure has been built with fossil fuel and nuclear plants in mind. \\nAlthough the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has launched \\nproceedings within the last year to address barriers to strengthening and \\nexpanding the nation’s tr ansmission system within existing grid regions, \\nthe U.S. currently lacks a plan for ensuring power transfers between those \\nregions. The federal regulator should require that neighboring regions plan \\nfor a minimum amount of interregional transfer capability  to ensure \\nstorm -affected areas can access a reliable power supply even when local \\ngenerators come offline.  \\nThis will pose a challenge for renewable energy sources located outside \\nof the existing transmission infrastructure. If renewable energy is to play a \\nmajor role in bridging the gap from fossil fuel generation, the need for \\ntransmission line capacity is estimated to triple. Large urban areas with \\nthe highest electricity needs are typically long distances from abundant \\nrenewable energy sources like wind , biomass, location sunlight, and \\nhydropower. There are also challenges with permitting and building \\nadditional power transmission lines, including the construction of \\ninterconnection upgrades to connect generation sources to the grid.  \\nThe influence of the Inflation Reduction Act on the grid will require a huge \\nshift in how much renewable energy flows into the grid to meet the \\nestablished goals of the IRA.   If the grid is not expanded on, it will restrict \\nthe success of renewable development  in many states. This requires \\nalignment with state and federal policies so that interconnection \\napplications are processed efficiently. A possible bright spot is FERC’s \\nproposed reforms aimed at improving the transmission planning process.  \\nThe current sta te of our national grid is best exemplified by Georgia \\nPower’s delay in shuttering some coal -fired units because the state’s \\ntransmission system can’t handle their exit from the grid or the renewable \\nenergy additions that would be needed to replace the pow er plants. \\nSituations like this are prevalent across the country.  \\n  \\nWhat else can be done to improve grid reliability?  \\nModernizing the grid is of the utmost importance. The grid needs to \\nbecome “smarter” and more resilient with cutting -edge technologies,', metadata={'source': './CgBotTesting.pdf', 'page': 18}), Document(page_content='equipment, and controls that communicate and work together to deliver \\nelectricity more reliably and efficiently. The result will be reduced \\nfrequency and duration of power outages, reduced storm impacts, and \\nfaster service restoration when outages occur. Ad ditionally, consumers \\ncan better manage their own energy consumption and costs because \\nthey have easier access to their own data. Utilities also benefit from a \\nmodernized grid, including improved security, reduced peak loads, \\nincreased integration of renew ables, and lower operational costs.  \\nThe need for transformation of the nation’s electric grid creates both \\nchallenges and opportunities to advance the capabilities of today’s \\nelectricity delivery system.   A critical component of grid modernization is \\na coo rdinated, strategic research, development and demonstration effort \\nthat involves both the public and private sectors.  \\nMany contend that renewables like wind and solar, as well as the \\nemerging capabilities of battery storage and other advanced \\ntechnologies will stabilize the grid’s reliability. Grid operators in California \\nare successfully using batteries to store solar power during the day and \\nprovide valuable energy as the sun sets but temperatures remain high, \\navoiding blackouts even as demand soars.  \\nBattery storage is a tool in the quest for a more reliable electric grid, with \\nthe potential to move from a just -in-time delivery system for low -cost \\nenergy to a system that can flexibly store and release power when \\nneeded. Batteries are most beneficial for en ergy storage when the wind \\nisn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.  \\nAnother solution is unlocking more local resources and “virtual power \\nplants” made up of small -scale resources like home batteries, EVs, \\nthermostats, and water heaters. These systems impro ve system reliability \\nby using software to better integrate electricity assets we’ve already paid \\nfor with the grid.  \\n  \\nKey Findings from the Department of Energy “Draft Report”  \\nThe United States will likely need 47,300 GW -miles of new transmission \\nby 2035,  a 57% increase compared to today’s transmission system under', metadata={'source': './CgBotTesting.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='a moderate load growth -high clean energy growth scenario, according to \\na Department of Energy Draft Report.  \\nThe Draft Report found the transmission needs in the U.S. are “pressing,” \\nthat inter -regional transmission offers the biggest benefits, and that the \\nneeds will shift over time, according to Adria Brooks, a transmission \\nplanning engineer in the Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office. \\n“Significant transmission deployment is needed as s oon as 2030 in the \\nPlains, Midwest and Texas regions, but by 2040, large deployments will \\nalso be needed in the Mountain and Mid -Atlantic and Southeast,” Brooks \\nsaid.  \\n“Large amounts of low -cost generation potential exist in the middle of the \\ncountry and ac cessing this generation through increased transmission is \\ncost effective for neighboring regions,” DOE said.  \\nBased on differences in market prices, the most value is found by \\nconnecting the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas to the Southwest \\nregion o f the Western Interconnection, followed by connecting ERCOT \\nwith the Eastern Interconnection, DOE said.  \\nThere is also “significant value” in connecting the Southwest Power Pool \\nwith the Mountain region of the Western Interconnection and with the \\nMidcontine nt Independent System Operator to the east, the department \\nsaid.  \\nNote: Department of Energy aims to issue a Final Report this summer, \\naccording to Brooks.  \\nA growing specialty retailer had outpaced the capabilities of its home -\\ngrown retail solutions.   The C ompany had added new product lines and \\nservices over the years to its core Loan/Pawn segment, and its current \\nsystems could not keep pace with the requirements.   After performing an \\nassessment to analyze “build versus buy” options they concluded that a \\n“buy” option would not fit their needs.   As part of the Retail system re -\\nengineering project facilitated by CG Infinity ,   it was determined that a \\nmobile app would significantly enhance the availability of pawned \\ninventory as it became available for sale.', metadata={'source': './CgBotTesting.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='Impact  \\nAt the point that a customer defaults on their loan, the items that a \\npawnshop is holding in custody become available for sale. The Company \\nis authorized to recover any outstanding loan amount thru the sale of the \\nitem. These items are typically heavi ly discounted versus standard retail; \\nhowever, their visibility is restricted to the store where it is physically \\ninventoried. The vision was to offer access to tens of thousands of unique \\nproducts across the chain via a mobile app.   The POS system did hav e \\nthe ability to view products across stores. However, this process was very \\ntime -consuming for the store associate and not customer -friendly or \\nefficient.  \\nSolution  \\nThe newly developed centralized Retail control module, managed and \\nmaintained all product Loan data. An eCommerce mobile app was \\ndeveloped that had APIs to the retail control module giving a 360 -degree \\nview of inventory. So, instead of waiting for a prospective customer to \\nbuy a single item for sale at a single store, the App facilitate d the broad \\nexposure of items across all stores, enhanced the customer shopping \\nexperience, and provided the ability to purchase directly from the mobile \\nApp.    \\nResult  \\nThe app’s main benefits were incremental sales, inventory turnover, and \\nenhanced customer satisfaction from the much -improved browsing and \\nshopping experience. Another benefit was customers’ ability  to use the \\napp at their leisure rather than having a stor e associate assist via the in -\\nstore POS significantly improving labor efficiency in the stores.', metadata={'source': './CgBotTesting.pdf', 'page': 21}), Document(page_content='The client for this opportunity was a smart -home technology and \\nsecurity company.
